TODO
====

Along with TODOs that can be found directly in the source file.
Here's TODOs that is in higher-level abstraction.

* Fix ``README.rst.txt``.
  There's so many big changes in the last revisions.

* Add test for ``blowgun::Texture`` and ``blowgun::Program``.
  Hint: the test will contain call to ``glIsTexture`` for ``blowgun::Texture``
  and ``glIsProgram`` for ``blowgun::Program``.

* The way vertex uploading designed is not optimal because too many overhead.
  Every vertex attribute contains ``type``, ``format``, and ``data``.

* Data-oriented-ify vertex data.
  The work for this has been started in ``vertices.h``
  and ``vertices_builder.h``.
