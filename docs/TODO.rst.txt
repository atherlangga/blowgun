TODO
====

Along with TODOs that can be found directly in the source file,
here's higher-level TODOs:

* Add test for ``blowgun::Texture`` and ``blowgun::Program``.
  Hint: the test will contain call to ``glIsTexture`` for ``blowgun::Texture``
  and ``glIsProgram`` for ``blowgun::Program``.

* The way vertex uploading designed is not optimal because too many overhead.
  Every vertex attribute contains ``type``, ``format``, and ``data``.
  Some of that information should be compressed/unified.

* Data-oriented-ify vertex data.
  This is related to previous point. Also, the work for this
  has been started in ``vertices.h`` and ``vertices_builder.h``.
